# Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam (CKA)

## How I prepared for

### My situation:
* 2 years of professional experience with K8s
* 17 years of professional experience in Linux

### Material / Courses
* **Kubernetes Documentation**: it is a valuable pool of information and its search function also finds bash commands such as: "busybox while true"
As it is the most important resource during the exam, I forced myself to solve my problems with tips and examples from the official docs.
In the exam it helps a lot to know which Docs article has your solution.


* **Udemy Course**: "Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests"

* **killer.sh** is now included free for all exam attendees on enrollment process

### Timeline
* took a whole of 2 months for preparation
* started with Udemy course and completed all the videos (18.5 hours) and practice tests (~10-15 hours)


* then took a few days of


* then repeated some Udemy videos I was not so self-confident with
* then repeated all Udemy practice tests for the 2nd time
* repeated the 3 mock exams on Udemy 3 times each to become faster


* scheduled the date for my exam (2 weeks ahead on a Sunday afternoon)
* again repeated some Udemy videos which I had not fully understood

### In the last week before the exam:
* **Monday**: did my first of two killer.sh sessions and performed badly (27%)
* **Tuesday**: reworked all Questions and Answers of killer.sh (without timer) to understand each solution
* **Wednesday**: picked a few Questions from killer.sh and tested them on my own local K8s cluster
* **Thursday**: took a day off
* **Friday**: started my 2nd killer.sh session and performed properly (around 90%) - I already knew the solutions from first run but this time I did it for a better feeling of time management
* **Saturday**: reworked a few Questions from killer.sh again
* **Sunday**: summit day.... erm... exam day. - Had a good feeling afterwards.
* **Monday**: Got my result: Passed!

### Tools

I use:
* kubectl autocompletion

I do not use:
* terminal managers such as tmux, just a plain single terminal
* command aliases for kubectl such as k=kubectl because I want to have clear commands other can also understand

### Environment
I set up my own local K8s cluster on a notebook
