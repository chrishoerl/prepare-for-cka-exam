### Timeline
* took a whole of 2 months for preparation
* started with Udemy course and completed all the videos (18.5 hours) and practice tests (~10-15 hours)


* then took a few days of


* then repeated some Udemy videos I was not so self-confident with
* then repeated all Udemy practice tests for the 2nd time
* repeated the 3 mock exams on Udemy 3 times each to become faster


* scheduled the date for my exam (2 weeks ahead on a Sunday afternoon)
* again repeated some Udemy videos which I had not fully understood

### In the last week before the exam:
* **Monday**: did my first of two killer.sh sessions and performed badly (27%)
* **Tuesday**: reworked all Questions and Answers of killer.sh (without timer) to understand each solution
* **Wednesday**: picked a few Questions from killer.sh and tested them on my own local K8s cluster
* **Thursday**: took a day off
* **Friday**: started my 2nd killer.sh session and performed properly (around 90%) - I already knew the solutions from first run but this time I did it for a better feeling of time management
* **Saturday**: reworked a few Questions from killer.sh again
* **Sunday**: summit day.... erm... exam day. - Had a good feeling afterwards.
* **Monday**: Got my result: Passed!
